# Employee-Management-System-Using-JAVA
This Employee Management System Project application stores all the employeeâ€™s information in a database. It is an application developed in Java GUI technology and database used is SQLite. It contains employee information like employee id, first name, surname, and age. It is an easy to use application and has a user-friendly interface. It is totally built at the administrative end which means that only the admin has access rights to change or modify any records. So this makes it safe and reliable application to use. The main aim of developing this application was to reduce the errors that occur in the manual system. One can search the details easily by just entering employee id. In earlier systems, there was not such a facility to do so. All the details are stored in an SQLite database. It is easy to update any employee details. All the employee records are integrated and so this makes it user-friendly and easy to use application.
